          always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
          warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
          below.
